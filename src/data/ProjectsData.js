        "I developed a project to create an e-commerce platform using modern web development technologies. Although my approach was initially based on an existing online store, I eventually decided to adapt the project to create a standalone e-commerce platform. During the development process, I used multiple tools and technologies, such as ReactJS, React Router 6, Framer Motion, Sass and learned a lot about how to work with these technologies together. In addition, the project allowed me to improve my programming skills and taught me how to create a web application from scratch.",

        description:  "I have experience using various CSS properties and techniques to enhance the appearance and functionality of web pages. This includes manipulating elements on the z-axis with translate3d(), adjusting values using calc(), using background-position to manipulate section backgrounds, and improving animation performance with will-change. I also use properties like scroll-behavior and overflow to create a smooth and seamless browsing experience. Additionally, I use text-shadow to add visual interest to text and window.addEventListener() to detect user scroll events and update CSS variables accordingly.",

        description: "I implemented events in the browser window using window.addEventListener to improve the interactivity of a game. I also used my knowledge of mathematics to create game logic, including collision detection, path calculation, and object animation. To create custom graphics and game elements, I used JavaScript canvas, adjusting sizes and positions to fit the user interface. In addition, I created and manipulated multidimensional arrays to store and organize relevant game data, such as object positions and player statistics. I also implemented custom events and buttons to improve the usability of the game and allow players to interact with it more intuitively. Finally, I used localStorage to store and retrieve relevant game data, such as player score and level progress.",
